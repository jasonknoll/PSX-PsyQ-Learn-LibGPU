# Learn libgpu and libgte for PSX

One of the first things I intend to accomplish with myh homebrew development is the ability to display graphics with intent. Right now, I can barely draw some triangles on screen. Soon enough I want to be able to make simple 2D games. In my head, it starts with being able to manipulate the graphics without confusion -- for now, I'm confused haha
